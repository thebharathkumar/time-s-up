# Real Time Age Analysis

This project was created as a simple time-killing experiment to explore age calculation based on user-inputted birthdates. The goal was to provide a straightforward and visually appealing tool for obtaining real-time age insights.

## Impact

While the project is meant to be a lighthearted and enjoyable way to pass the time, it also serves as a reminder of the power of technology to make complex calculations seamlessly. Additionally, it can be used as a starting point for more sophisticated age analysis applications or integrated into other projects.
